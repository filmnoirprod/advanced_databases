# Advanced topics in databases
This project was developped as part of the 9th semester course, Advanced Topics in databases (of the National Technical University of Athens) taught by Ionnis Konstantinou (http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~ikons/) in the winter semester of 2018.At this project I had the opportunity to implement algorithms in map reduce context using Apache Spark and Hadoop (HDFS) on a distributed cluster.
