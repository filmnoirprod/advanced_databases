# Advanced topics in databases
This project was developped as part of the 9th semester course, Advanced Topics in databases (of the National Technical University of Athens) taught by Ionnis Konstantinou (http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~ikons/) in the winter semester of 2018. At this project I had the opportunity to implement algorithms in map reduce context using Apache Spark and Hadoop (HDFS) on a distributed cluster.

## Exercise 1 - Data Analytics 
The first exercise was all about data analytics . We worked on the new york yellow cab dataset (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2015-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/ba8s-jw6u) and we had to implement two different actions on this dataset . At first we had to calculate the average trip duration for each hour of day (/codes/ex1a.py). Then we calculated the maximum amount of money paid to each different taxi company for one single route (/codes/ex2a.py) . At this step we actually found that the dataset had some wrong data as the cost was too big ( around 500000 $ for a single ride) . As a result , we cleared the dataset as part of preprocessing by removing routes that costed more than 5000 $ per ride .
